Hi All,

This is my first attempt at creating something that scrapes an Instagram viewer to get 3 pieces of info:

1.Hashtag name
2. The amount of photos that have that hashtag
3. The other hashtags that appeared on that page when it was scraped.

At the moment it goes into a .txt file which is formatted with easy copy/paste into excel (I'm OSX).

I'd apriciate imput or people who want to collaborate. In the future I want to turn this into a RoR project that puts this info into a database. It would be cool if this project has the following columns

1. ID
2. Unique Hashtags (no repeats)
3. Amount of times that hashtag has been scraped.
4. Related tags for each specific time the tag was scraped.
(To be continued in next update.)


Eventually, I would like it if this script referenced a database or file and automatically started scraping new unique tags (urls) that it hadn't scraped before. 

Lastly, at the moment there's plenting of "puts". I think I tried taking them out and things got buggy. Working on it. 

Cheers,
B
